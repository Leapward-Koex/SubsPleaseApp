# SubsPlease App (Unofficial)

This is a React native app that gets the latest releases from the SubsPlease API and presents them here.
Only built with Android in mind.
It includes
- The magnet links to download the torrents (720p and 1080p)
- Downloading the episodes within the app to a user specified location using longpress of resolution button (remembers locations for subsequent episodes)
- The Synopsis + image of the show
- A watchlist feature to keep track of the shows you're watching and what days they come out on
- A search feature that uses the SubsPlease search API to find any shows that are available on the website

Data such as the historical show list + synopsis are cached on the device so you can access more shows in chronological releases than the SubsPlease API will allow
